                    <h4>Dental Exams</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dental exams are an important part of preventative tooth care.
                        Dental exams can include teeth cleanings, x-rays, and an evaluation of your oral health and risks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>X-Rays</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dental x-rays can be either intraoral or extraoral, to view both the teeth and structure surrounding the teeth.
                        X-rays are used to visualize tooth decay, changes in bone density, abnormalities in roots, and tooth placement.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Composite Fillings</h4>
                    <p>
                        Composite fillings are a type of "white filling" made from a composite resin.
                        Composite fillings can be color matched to your teeth so that they blend in.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Inlay Restorations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inlays are used when decay or fracture is so extensive that normal fillings will not suffice.
                        By decreasing the "tooth-to-restoration" margin the chances of further decay is further decreased.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Onlay Restorations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Onlays provide the same benefits of inlays, but are more extensive, covering multiple cusps.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Prophylaxis (Teeth Cleaning)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Teeth cleanings are a standard part of oral maintenance.
                        Prophylaxis includes supragingival cleaning, subgingival cleaning, polishing, sulcal lavage,
                        fluoride treatment, treatment planning, and dental charting.
                    </p>

                <h2>Endodontics</h2>
                    <h4>Apicoectomy</h4>
                    <p>
                        Also know as "root end surgery", an apicoectomy is a surgical procedure where the tip of a tooth
                        is removed and a root end cavity is filled. Most often an apicoectomy is required when root canal
                        therapy is not sufficient or was unsuccessful.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Root Canal Therapy</h4>
                    <p>
                        Root canal therapy treats infected and/or decayed pulp of a tooth. Located at the core of your tooth,
                        an infection of the pulp can lead a tooth to fall out, facial swelling, and excruciating pain.
                        Root canal therapy restores your tooth health and allows you to continue to eat and speak pain free.
                    </p>

                <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dental implants are replacement tooth roots that can be used with either permanent or removable
                        replacement teeth. Dental implants are permanent and can improve speech, appearance, comfort when
                        dealing with replacement teeth.
                    </p>

                <h2>Cosmetic Dentistry</h2>

                <h4>Bonding</h4>

                <p>
                    Bonding is a procedure in which resin is applied to a tooth and hardened.
                    Bonding can be used to close spaces in between teeth, change how teeth look (color, shape, length),
                    repair decayed, chipped, or cracked teeth, and protect a tooth's root. Bonding is a relatively easy
                    and inexpensive cosmetic procedure that removes very little enamel compared to veneers or crowns.
                    Depending on your dental habits bonding may need to be touched-up or redone every three to ten years.
                </p>
                <h4>Porcelain Veneers</h4>

                <p>
                    Porcelain veneers are very thin "shells" of porcelain custom made for individual teeth.
                    Porcelain veneers can improve the color, shape, size, or length of your teeth. Porcelain veneers are
                    commonly used to fix teeth that have been chipped, worn down, uneven, bulging, misaligned, broken,
                    or gaps between teeth.
                </p>

                <h4>Porcelain Inlays</h4>

                <p>
                    Porcelain inlays are a specific type of filling which lies within the "cusps" of a tooth.
                    Porcelain, like resin, is tooth colored; but porcelain is more resistant to stains.
                </p>

                <h4>Porcelain Onlays</h4>

                <p>
                    Porcelain onlays, also known as partial crowns, are similar to porcelain inlays,
                    but are more extensive and can cover multiple cusps.
                </p>

                <h4>Tooth Whitening</h4>

                <p>
                    Gaps and color are the most important aspects to a smile. Making a tooth whitening appointment
                    is the quickest way to improve the color of your teeth. Many over-the-counter products can be
                    used to maintain a bright smile, but none of them can "get the job done" as quickly as a professional
                    in-office treatment.
                </p>

                <h2>Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery</h2>

                <h4>Corrective Jaw Surgery (Orthognathic Surgery)</h4>

                <p>
                    Orthognathic Surgery is performed to correct jaw and face conditions related to growth and structure.
                    For example, corrective jaw surgery is used to treat congenital conditions, such as "cleft palate".
                </p>

                <h4>Facial Trauma Reconstruction</h4>

                <p>
                    Injuries can necessitate the need for craniofacial reconstruction. Every incident is different,
                    and the extent of surgery is dependent on the severity of the trauma.
                </p>

                <h4>Impacted Canines</h4>

                <p>
                    The mouth contains four canine teeth. "Impacted" is a term used to refer to teeth that cannot break
                    trough the gums. Impacted teeth can lead to infections and pain. The maxillary canine is thesecond
                    most common type of tooth to become impacted.
                </p>

                <h4>Wisdom Teeth Extractions</h4>

                <p>
                    Wisdom teeth are not necessary for normal mouth function, and do not appear until someone is seventeen
                    to twenty-five years old. Wisdom teeth are the most likely tooth type to become impacted. Wisdom tooth
                    extractions are a very common procedure.
                </p>

                <h4>Gum & Jawbone Corrective Treatments</h4>

                <p>
                    Periodontal disease, facial trauma, and birth defects can require gum and jawbone corrective treatment.
                    This includes crown lengthening, pocket reduction surgery, gum grafts, bone grafts, ridge modification,
                    and sinus augmentation.
                </p>

                <h4>Oral Cancer Exam</h4>

                <p>
                    Oral cancer can manifest in the gums, lips, tongue, cheek lining, mouth floor, and mouth roof.
                    Tobacco, including smoking, and alcohol use have been linked to increasing risk of oral cancer.
                    Oral cancer spreads quickly, so regular exams are very important. Since it can manifest initials
                    as white plaque, ulcers, sores, or lumps it is hard to self-diagnose.
                </p>

                <h4>Sinus Augmentation</h4>

                <p>
                    In this procedure bone is grafted to the upper jaw near the morals and premolars.
                    This is done to support the base of a dental implant, which can be install led at the same time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nearly one-half of oral surgeries are soft tissue grafting, which can be required for implants
                    recessions, and some cosmetic procedures.
                </p>

                <h4>Regenerative Procedures</h4>

                <p>
                    Regenerative procedures are used to treat gum disease, commonly manifested by a lack tooth support
                    or bone loss. These procedures involve cutting back gums, removing bacteria, and placement of proteins,
                    bone grafts, or membranes.
                </p>

                <h4>Ridge Modification</h4>

                <p>
                    Ridge modification is used when prepping the mouth for dental implants, and includes modifcations

                <h4>Periodontal Scaling & Root Planning</h4>

                <p>
                    Scaling and root planning is also known as conventional periodontal therapy, non-surgical periodontal
                    therapy, or dental prophylaxis. This procedure is used to remove or eliminate the causes of inflammation
                    and disease.
                </p>

                <h4>Pocket Irrigation</h4>

                <p>
                    Inter-dental cleaning, subgingival cleaning, and antimicrobial application are the main components
                    of pocket irrigation. The point of pocket irrigation is to remove debris from between teeth and around
                    the gum line, this helps prevent halitosis.
                </p>

                <h4>Pocket Reduction Surgery</h4>

                <p>

                </p>

                <h4>Bone Grafting</h4>

                <p>Bone grafting replaces missing bone in cases of fractures, disease, and trauma. Bone, unlike most
                    other tissue types, can regenerate through the process of osteoconduction, osteoinduction, osteopromotion,
                    or osteogenisis.
                </p>

                <h2>Prosthodontics</h2>
